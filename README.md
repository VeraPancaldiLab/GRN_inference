# GRN_inference
Under imporvement 

Here we follow the steps from GRN inference of regulatory network (focussing on macrophage polarization) to intracellular Boolean modelling:
* apply different methods (GENIE3, GeneBoost2) methods to infer GRN of macrophage polarization;
* apply methods (eg. Bonnesis) on BM inference and analyse the stability of the system.
